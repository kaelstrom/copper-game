Hey John,

We just wanted to send an email to see how how you were handling things now that we�re going to be away campaigning for the rest of the month. We know it�s hard on you but know you can always talk to us. We�ve added you to our credit card and have ordered one from the credit card company. It should be arriving any day, and you should be getting an email notification telling you some more detailed information. This is ONLY for emergencies! It�ll make us feel better that you have it, but it�s not meant for any partying around. We hope you�re doing well and can�t wait to see you!

MISSION: You have been created and sent to manipulate a boy, John, into spending as much money on things as you can possibly make him. You have about a month before John�s first credit statement comes through and his parents know how much he�s been spending. Make him spend as much as possible and your mission has succeeded. You have been implanted within the drivers in John�s new printer. If John becomes suspicious enough of your work to run a sophisticated virus scanner, you could be discovered and eradicated. This is not an acceptable outcome. Good luck, and God Speed AI.

Influence his son, John, into openly opposing his father�s values and ideals by election day, the end of the month. Again, make sure you do not make John suspicious, you must stay under the radar.
